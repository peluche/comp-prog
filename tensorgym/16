    Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between two tensors.

    This function supports tensors of any dimensionality, as long as the input_tensor
    and target_tensor have the same shape.

    Args:
    input_tensor (torch.Tensor): The tensor holding the predicted values.
    target_tensor (torch.Tensor): The tensor holding the true values.

    Returns:
    torch.Tensor: A scalar tensor containing the mean squared error between the input and target tensors.
